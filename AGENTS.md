# Agent Instructions

- Keep `/changelog` accurate. The changelog is auto-updated on each push via GitHub Actions using `scripts/update-changelog.mjs`.
- When making significant changes, verify the changelog entry was created and the `/changelog` page renders properly.

- Changelog updates are auto-generated; do not edit entries manually unless establishing a baseline.
